                                If the light strip turns on or the robot powers on, it means the battery was too low to power on the robot.

                                If the exterior appears normal, use a multimeter to test if the output voltage is within the normal range of 29.4±0.2V.

                                Reconnect the charger or check for a good contact.
                                If the contact is poor, the charging port needs to be replaced.

                                Remove the battery and use a multimeter to test if the ground resistance of the battery communication line is normal.
                                Check for a short circuit between the blue and red wires (communication cable: black GND, blue SCL clock line, red SDA data line).
                                Test the resistance values between blue to black and blue to black, which should be above 0.8M (for Ganfeng batteries). A resistance value above 0.8M is considered normal.
                                If the readings are abnormal, replace the battery.
                                For BYD batteries, replace the battery and cross-verify. If normal after replacement, the issue lies with the battery.

                                The connected network is abnormal, such as the hotspot cannot connect to the external network.
                                Try switching to a normal network/hotspot (an Android system phone hotspot is recommended), enter the Android system, use the built-in WebView or other browsers to test if it can connect to the external network (such as google.com).
                                If it can connect to the external network normally, it means the issue is resolved.

                                This situation is common in scenarios like exhibitions, where too many hotspots/WiFi networks interfere with each other, making connections impossible.
                                Try adjusting the frequency band and channel of the hotspot/WiFi to see if it returns to normal.
                                If the machine still cannot connect normally after changing environments, there might be a hardware issue.

                                Check if the switch has been accidentally turned off or similarly affected, and try to turn it back on.
                                If the WiFi can be reactivated by turning the switch back on, it indicates that the WiFi functionality of the device is in a normal state.
                                If it still cannot be turned on, further investigation into other possible causes is necessary.
